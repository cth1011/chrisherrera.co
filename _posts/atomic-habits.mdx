I've followed James Clear's blog during my college days, and I found his productivity
tips immensely useful. I was delighted to hear that he wrote a book about habits.
Honestly, I didn't rush into the book despite how good his [blog](https://jamesclear.com/)
was. Having read Charles Duhigg's Power of Habit, I felt like I didn't need to pursue
this book since I already know the whole concept of how habits are formed. I gave
it a read anyway, and I wished I read this sooner.

## Why I love this book

This book is full of action-packed insights on pushing through the habits you set. I love the many examples he tackled in the book whether exercising, meditating, or losing weight. I got a lot out of each chapter, and I love the emphasis of starting small each day.

## How it changed my life

I read a chapter, where you should first standardize instead of optimizing. Sometimes, we get too hungover with how the perfect routine should look like when what really matters more is showing up. I stopped overthinking the optimal ways of performing the habit and just started doing it.

I downloaded the Calm app and got back into meditating and gratitude journal-ling. I focused mainly on how I could consistently perform these habits. I used to do 10 minutes of meditation but decided to make it 5 minutes.

## Who should read this?

I highly recommend you read this if you're looking to break out of your bad habits. The book will definitely help you understand why you continuously perform bad habits even if you're well aware of the consequences.

The book is also a great read to help you find small ways to incorporate positive habits into your life. You'll definitely find something that'll work into your daily routine.
