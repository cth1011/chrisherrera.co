## Introduction

I was taking up the Mapbox GL JS exam, and I decided that I wanted to fully flex my web development skills for this exam. I used a [COVID-19 Japan API](https://github.com/ryo-ma/covid19-japan-web-api#data-sources) that was updated daily. It was pretty straightforward to use with the necessary data points I wanted to project onto a map. I visualized all prefectures of Japan with their corresponding cases and tests.

Using d3.js, I visualized the trend of daily cases and tests added. The case breakdown was also visualized by <span tw='text-red-50'>Severe</span>, <span tw='text-orange-50'>Active</span>, <span tw='text-green-50'>Recovered</span>, and <span tw='text-grey-50'>Death</span> through a stacked bar chart. I love the animations when hovering over from one prefecture to another.

It was a fun web application to build in my past time, and well worth the time spent developing. For the record, I passed the Mapbox exam. I'm looking forward to building more web applications using Mapbox.

Here's the link to the [tracker](https://covid-japan.web.app/)!
