Recently, I dove deep into web.dev's accessibility documentation, and I wanted to share what I learned about making websites more accessible. As frontend developers, it's crucial we understand these concepts to create inclusive web experiences. Here's how I applied the **80/20 principle** to focus on the most impactful accessibility practices.

## The Foundation: Semantic HTML

One of the most effective ways to improve accessibility is by using **semantic HTML**. This provides structure and meaning to your content, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret.

### Why Semantic HTML Matters
- Screen readers rely on semantic elements to navigate and describe content.
- Proper use of headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) creates a logical document outline.
- Native HTML elements come with built-in accessibility features.

### Example: Proper Document Structure

```html
<header>
    <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
        {/* Navigation content */}
    </nav>
</header>

<main>
    <h1>Main Content Heading</h1>
    <section aria-labelledby="intro-heading">
        <h2 id="intro-heading">Introduction</h2>
        {/* Section content */}
    </section>
</main>

<footer>
    {/* Footer content */}
</footer>
```

## ARIA: Use It Sparingly and Correctly

While ARIA can enhance accessibility, it should complementâ€”not replaceâ€”semantic HTML. Overusing ARIA can actually make your site less accessible.


### The Five Rules of ARIA

1. Don't Use ARIA Unnecessarily: Native HTML is almost always better.
2. Prefer Native HTML Elements: Use `<button>` instead of `<div role="button">`.
3. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility: Every interactive ARIA control must be keyboard-operable.
4. Use `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` Wisely: Provide clear descriptions for complex elements.
5. Test with Screen Readers: ARIA changes should be verified with actual assistive technologies.

### Example: ARIA Done Right

```html
{/* Don't do this */}
<div role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="submitForm()">Submit</div>

{/* Do this instead */}
<button onclick="submitForm()">Submit</button>
```

## Keyboard Accessibility: A Must-Have

Keyboard accessibility is one of the most critical aspects of web accessibility. Many users rely on keyboards or keyboard-like devices to navigate websites.

### Key Practices
1. Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, forms) are focusable and usable with a keyboard.
2. Use `tabindex="0"` to make elements focusable and `tabindex="-1"` to remove them from the tab order.
3. Avoid `tabindex` values greater than 0, as they can disrupt the natural tab order.

### Example: Skip Link for Keyboard Users

```jsx
const SkipLink = () => {
  return (
    <a 
      href="#main-content" 
      className="skip-link"
      style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        top: '-40px',
        left: 0,
        background: '#000',
        color: '#fff',
        padding: '8px',
        zIndex: 100,
        // Only show when focused
        ':focus': {
          top: 0
        }
      }}
    >
      Skip to main content
    </a>
  )
}
```

## Focus Management: Don't Break the Flow

  Proper focus management ensures users always know where they are on the page. This is especially important for dynamic content like modals or dropdowns.

### Key Practices
- Ensure focus indicators are visible (don't remove outline in CSS without providing an alternative).
- Move focus to new content (e.g., modals) when it appears.
- Trap focus within modals to prevent users from tabbing outside.

## Images: Alt Text and Descriptions

Images are a key part of web content, but they need to be accessible to everyone.

### Key Practices
- Use alt text for meaningful images.
- Leave alt empty (`alt=""`) for decorative images.
- Use `aria-describedby` for complex images that need additional context.

### Example: Informative Image

```html
<img 
  src="chart.jpg" 
  alt="Quarter 4 sales showing 25% increase over Q3"
  aria-describedby="chart-description"
/>
<p id="chart-description" className="visually-hidden">
  Detailed breakdown of Q4 sales performance...
</p>
```

## Language Management: Declare and Specify

Proper language declarations help screen readers pronounce content correctly.

### Example: Language Declaration

```html
<html lang="en">
  <head>{/* ... */}</head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello! In French, we say: <span lang="fr">Bonjour!</span></p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Learnings and Best Practices

1. Start with Semantic HTML: It solves many accessibility issues before they begin.
2. Test with Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements are usable with a keyboard.
3. Use ARIA Sparingly: Only when native HTML isn't sufficient.
4. Ensure Visible Focus States: Always make focus indicators clear and meet contrast requirements.
5. Test with Real Users: Involve people with disabilities in your testing process.

## Tools I Found Helpful

- Chrome DevTools Accessibility Inspector: For quick audits.
- WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool): For detailed reports.
- axe DevTools: For automated testing.
- Screen Readers (NVDA, VoiceOver): For manual testing.
- Keyboard Navigation Testing: Ensure all functionality is keyboard-accessible.

## Closing Thoughts

Learning about web accessibility has fundamentally changed how I approach frontend development. It's not just about complianceâ€”it's about creating a better web experience for all users, regardless of how they interact with our content.
